# Media Module (9.x compatible Edition)

This 9.x version of the module exists just so you can pull it in and uninstall it.
Make sure to uninstall all the modules this one requires first:

"drupal/image_widget_crop": "2.1",
"drupal/media_entity_image": "^1.2",
"drupal/media_entity_document": "^1.1",
"drupal/entity_embed": "^1.0-beta2",
"drupal/entity_browser": "2.0-alpha2",
"drupal/video_embed_field": "2.0-alpha2",
"drupal/media_entity_twitter": "2.0-alpha2",
"drupal/media_entity_instagram": "2.0-alpha1"

If your site is using any of these modules itself, you should add them to your composer.json file.
